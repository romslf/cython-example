This repo contains an example on how to convert a python script to C, and then create an executable from it.

> Keep in mind that this is a very simple example and that you can do much more with cython. Check out the [cython documentation](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information.

# Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- C compiler (gcc, clang, etc) (see [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) for windows)

# How to use

1. Before doing anything, make sure you have the prerequisites installed.
2. ```pip install --upgrade setuptools``` (This is to make sure you have the latest version of setuptools)
3. ```pip install cython``` (This is to make sure you have cython installed)
4. Edit ```build.bat``` to match your python version and path, compiler and executable name
5. Run ```build.bat```

Two folders should have been created, ```C``` and ```dist```. C contains the C files generated by cython, and dist contains the executable.

You should now have your executable built and ready to use !
